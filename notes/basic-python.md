# Python Fundamentals

## Python Overview
- **Interpreted Language:** Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- **Creator:** Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further enhanced by the Python Software Foundation.
- **Readable Syntax:** Designed with a focus on readability and expressiveness, allowing logical concepts to be expressed in fewer lines of code.
- **Programming Paradigms:** Supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. <br />
  **Paradigms:** A programming paradigm is a model or style of programming that defines a set of principles, techniques, and patterns for writing code to solve problems on a computer.


## Key Features

Extensibility and Modularity:
Python was designed to be highly extensible and modular.

Modularity: Breaking down tasks into clearly defined, independent sub-tasks (modules) that can be combined, replaced, or upgraded without affecting other parts of the system.
Extensible: Can be extended with new modules and functions as needed.
White Space Syntax:

Uses indentation and white spaces to define code structure, making it similar to natural English language.
Built-in Tools:

Includes its own data types, operators, and functions for executing tasks and creating reusable modules.
Libraries:

Modules and Libraries: Modules can be grouped into libraries for specific domains.
Open Source: Most Python libraries are open source, allowing access, modification, and contributions from the community.
