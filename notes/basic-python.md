# Python Fundamentals

## Python Overview
- **Interpreted Language:** Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- **Creator:** Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further enhanced by the Python Software Foundation.
- **Readable Syntax:** Designed with a focus on readability and expressiveness, allowing logical concepts to be expressed in fewer lines of code.
- **Programming Paradigms:** Supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. <br />
  **Paradigms:** A programming paradigm is a model or style of programming that defines a set of principles, techniques, and patterns for writing code to solve problems on a computer.


## Key Features

Extensibility and Modularity:<br />
Python was designed to be highly extensible and modular.

Modularity: Breaking down tasks into clearly defined, independent sub-tasks (modules) that can be combined, replaced, or upgraded without affecting other components of the system.<br />
Extensible: Can be extended with new modules and functions as needed.

White Space Syntax:
Python has a unique “white space” based syntax which is quite similar to the natural English 
language.

Built-in Tools:
Includes its own data types, operators, and functions for executing tasks and creating reusable modules.

Libraries:
Modules and Libraries: Modules can be grouped into libraries for specific domains.
Open Source: Most Python libraries are open source, allowing access, modification, and contributions from the community.

## Ecosystem

Python has a vibrant ecosystem of libraries covering various fields:
- Linear Algebra
- Data Visualization
- Astrophysics
- Medicine
- Stock Trading
- Machine Learning
- Data Science

## HIGH LEVEL AND LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES:
Imagine you’re writing a letter to your friend. You use words, sentences, and paragraphs to make it easy to read and understand. High-level programming languages are a bit like that. They are designed to make it easy for people, like you and me, to write computer programs.

For example
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
In Python, you can use simple words and commands to tell the computer what to do. This program tells the computer to print “Hello, world!” on the screen.

Now, imagine building a super-detailed model of a spaceship with lots of tiny, specific pieces. Low-level programming languages are like that. They give you more control over the computer, but they can be tricky because you need to be very precise.

One of the lowest-level languages is called Assembly language. Here’s a tiny part of an Assembly program:
```
MOV AX, 5
ADD BX, AX
```
In Assembly, you work with small, detailed instructions that tell the computer exactly what to do. This code tells the computer to move the number 5 into a special place called AX and then add it to another number in BX. That is, This tells the computer to do some math, but it’s not easy to understand.

So in short, <br />
High Level Language:
Examples: Python, Java, C++
Readability: Easy to read and write, similar to natural language.
Usage: Ideal for programmers to write complex applications quickly.
Translation: Needs to be translated into low level code to run on a computer.

Low Level Language: <br />
Examples: Assembly, Machine Code
Readability: Hard to read and write, very close to machine instructions.
Usage: Directly interacts with computer hardware, very fast and memory efficient.
Execution: Computers can run low level code directly without translation.
